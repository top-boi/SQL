In this SQL code, I am querying a database that is holding Netflix data to answer questions about the data.
--Join the tables

SELECT people.cast, people.director, titles.type, titles.title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
LEFT JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" titles
ON people.show_id=titles.show_id; 

--How many MOVIE titles are there in the database?

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie';


--When was the most recent batch of tv shows and/or movies added to the database?

SELECT MAX(date(date_added))
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info";


--List all movies and tv shows in alphabetical order.

SELECT title
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
ORDER BY title asc;


--Who was the director of the movie Bright Star?

SELECT director
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info" title
LEFT OUTER JOIN "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_people" people
ON people.show_id=title.show_id
WHERE title.title='Bright Star';


--What is the oldest movie in the database and what year was it made?

SELECT title, release_year
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie'
AND release_year <= (SELECT MIN(release_year)
FROM "CharlotteChaze/BreakIntoTech"."netflix_titles_info"
WHERE type='Movie');
